Hey EC!

Rush may seem far away but it's time to start the planning process. 
Bring your ideas to the *first rush planning meeting tuesday 2/19 at 
10pm in talbot* (the tuesday that is an institute monday). We're mostly 
interested in big project ideas at this point but feel free to bring up 
anything you're enthusiastic about.

Thanks!

Hey guys,
Tomorrow evening at Dormcon, we'll be electing some new positions,
including VP for Rex.   This is the person who coordinates REX and CPW
between all the dorms and is a pretty important job. It would be great to
have an EC/East side friendly person in this position, and it would also be
a great opportunity for someone to get involved with not only EC rush and
CPW, but the greater MIT student community, and you'll also get to know
some cool admins and get to see a lot of how REX and CPW work.  If you want
to read more specifics about the job, you can go
here<http://web.mit.edu/dormcon/constitution/>.
 You can also feel free to e-mail or come talk to me or Leonid about it, if
you're interested.
If you'd like to come to Dormcon and run, the meeting is tomorrow (2/14) at
5 pm, at Next House, and you will likely not have to stay for the whole
meeting.

Hi EC,

Student Disabilities Services are looking for one or two people who are
good at Java (and tutoring) to help a blind student with the work required
for 1.00 (Intro to Java Programming).  Anyone who has taken 1.00 or is a
confident computer programmer can inquire.  This is a time commitment of
3-6 hours a week, including tutoring and lecture attendance, and is paid.
 You would work in a team with two or three other students from various
departments.  If interested, I have some information about the job or you
can go ahead and talk to Kara Brown at Student Disabilities Services (
k_brown@mit.edu) (asap, since the class has started).

Thanks
Phoebe
Do YOU want to let an EC resident how much you care? Do YOU trust desk

Greetings Comrades,

The most important thing I will say in this email is that *Your CPW event
proposals are due to us on Monday.*  Please please please do not let this
deadline stop you from doing something awesome for cpw.  The bar here is so
low you could trip on it.  "I'm doing individually addressable prefrosh
need macbook air eom" is almost sort of sufficient.

We had the first CPW meeting on Tuesday, and we came up with a lot of great
ideas.  There is a wiki (wiki wiki)
page<http://ec.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=CPW_2013> with
all the ideas that were generated.  If an idea listed there is yours, we
encourage you to put your name next to it and FOR THE LOVE OF GOD SUBMIT A
PROPOSAL.  If you're looking for an event idea, see if there's anything on
there that inspires you.  If you weren't at the meeting but have an idea,
go ahead and add it.  And submit a proposal.

Sign up to host a prefrosh here<http://community.mitcpw.org/pages/host.shtml>.
 It greatly benefits EC to have as many kids as possible experiencing
things first hand, and you might even have some fun doing it.

Add yourself to the CPW mailing list at
https://groups.mit.edu/webmoira/list/easternbloc or with blanche -a
yourathena easternbloc
If you were on maseeh-cpw, you are already on easternbloc.  We'll only send
a few more emails to ec-announce, so do this now.

In case you hadn't noticed, the theme of this year's CPW is soviet brand
communism.  Start working on your accents now.  Also, we're going to need
some propaganda, if you're into that kind of thing.

Remember; this cpw is happening at the beginning of a four day weekend, so
you'll have all the time in the world to spend molding prefrosh into the
east side citizens of tomorrow.

6 paragraphs.  Not bad.

In the vein of finishing years-old projects before I leave you lovely fuckers, the mobile elliptical is currently finished and in the courtyard. Feel free to take it places but shoot me a text at 773-236-7362 (easily remembered as 773-BEN-SENA). I'll be locking it as Soon as I de-rust the cylinder, but enjoy!

Also if you're ever bored and feel like helping me wrap up some other shot drop me a line.Any chance anyone's going to New Orleans on Monday?

Hey y'all,

After walking back from Rocky, I realized I was missing my other jacket.  It's a small black jean jacket.  Inside was my HFZ, room key, and a zebra-patterned key.  Anyone seen it around?  Sorry to spam, I know how often I pull shit like this.

Thanks,

Power in my room (Wa308 on 3E) is suddenly out. Hall and bathroom power
still on. Anyone else?
Might I suggest you check with the people in Wa108, 208, 408, and 508? Alternatively, check the breaker panels in the basement and on your hall for any tripped circuits. Outlets mounted on the wall are fed from the sub panels on your hall, and the ones in the wall are fed from the basement panels. Basement breakers are shared by stacked rooms. Which is why plugging two ACs and a fridge into one outlet is not only a bad idea, but it's also inconsiderate to those who share your electrical feed.

Great. Sounds like you've diagnosed the problem. Look for something that looks like this on the western wall of the Walcott basement hallway.

Also, if there is a tripped breaker, you might want to move any large loads onto a mounted outlet, since those have a higher carrying capacity per outlet.

My laptop (Lenovo Ideapad U400) doesn't know that it is plugged in. If someone has the same cord  (which is a Lenovo Model ADP-65XB A) could I please borrow it for a few minutes to see if the issue is just that my cord died?

[If my laptop does recognize your cord and you don't need it for the next 12 hours, I'd love to borrow it, but my main concern is to find out what the issue is.]

it's some gross shit.
Hi All,

I'm one of the internship coordinators at edX and we're soliciting
applications for sw engineering internships. We have three internships -
software engineering, content engineering, and devops. SW engineering
requires more technical skill and will help develop our platform further.
Content engineers work on the content side, developing tools such as
automated scripts, applets, and more to help further students' engagement
with materials. Devops intern will work on scalable infrastructure issues.
This is a very challenging - but VERY rewarding - position for the right
person.

Both are very interesting positions and offer you a chance to learn and
grow, while keeping you based in Boston for the summer (we're a short walk
away from campus, so you can even have campus housing). We plan to have an
internship program, including mentors, so you won't be thrown off the deep
end (although if you really wish to jump into the deep end on a crazy
project we can certainly accomodate that too!).

Qualifications (both engineering positions):
* Experience with Git (preferred) or other version control software
* Proficiency with Python
* Web experience (XML/HTML; CSS a plus)
* Not scared by a terminal
* Strong interest in education and desire to help make education better

Bonus qualifications (one or more strongly preferred; both engineering
positions)
* Javascript
* Java
* Django
* sql/mysql

Devops Qualifications:
* Linux hacker and enthusiast. Ideally you live and breathe Linux
* Strong interest and experience in scalable computing, distributed
computing, and/or cloud computing
* Desire to work on our site's infrastructure, making it more scalable,
more reliable, and more awesome.

Please send me your resume by next Friday, 3/1, if you wish to apply.
Please include your email address and your github account URL (if
applicable) directly on your resume.

The Story of Purim:

Esther Chapter 9:

1 Now in the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have rule over them; whereas it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them; 2 the Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king JoeG, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt; and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them was fallen upon all the peoples. 3 And all the princes of the provinces, and the satraps, and the governors, and they that did the king's business, helped the Jews; because the fear of Tetazoo was fallen upon them. 4 For Tetazoo was great in the king's house, and his fame went forth throughout all the provinces; for the man Tetazoo waxed greater and greater. 5 And the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword, and with slaughter and destruction, and did what they would unto them that hated them. 6 And in East Campus the castle the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.

{S} 7 And  {S} Stickman, and  {S} First East, and
{S} Putz, 8 and  {S} Beast, and
{S} Floor Pi, and  {S} Desk, 9 and
{S} 41W, and  {S} SlugFest, and
{S} Fifth West, and {S} Florey,

{S} 10 the ten sons of EC the son of Senior Haus, the Jews' enemy, slew they; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. 11 On that day the number of those that were slain in East Campus the castle was brought before the king. 12 And the king said unto Kelly the queen: 'The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in East Campus the castle, and the ten sons of EC; what then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now whatever thy petition, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request further, it shall be done.' 13 Then said Kelly: 'If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in MIT to do to-morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let EC's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.' 14 And the king commanded it so to be done; and a decree was given out in MIT; and they hanged EC's ten sons. 15 And the Jews that were in MIT gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in MIT; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. 16 And the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand--but on the spoil they laid not their hand-- 17 on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and drinking. 18 But the Jews that were in East Campus assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and drinking. 19 Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a holiday, and of giving food to one another. 20 And Tetazoo wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king JoeG, both nigh and far, 21 to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 22 the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and drinking, and of giving food to one another, and gifts to the poor. 23 And the Jews took upon them to do as they had begun, and as Tetazoo had written unto them; 24 because EC the son of Senior Haus, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast pur, that is, the lot, to discomfit them, and to destroy them; 25 but when she came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head; and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 26 Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them, 27 the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year; 28 and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.

Come Celebrate Purim with Tetazoo and Jew food at JewFac 5pm Today in Talbot

Please Bring a Bowl/Spoon
This is now. Bring your bowl and spoon

Now whatever thy petition, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request further, it shall be done.' 13 Then said Kelly: 'If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews that are in MIT to do to-morrow also according unto this day's decree, and let EC's ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.' 14 And the king commanded it so to be done; and a decree was given out in MIT; and they hanged EC's ten sons. 15 And the Jews that were in MIT gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men in MIT; but on the spoil they laid not their hand. 16 And the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their enemies, and slew of them that hated them seventy and five thousand--but on the spoil they laid not their hand-- 17 on the thirteenth day of the month Adar, and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and drinking. 18 But the Jews that were in East Campus assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and drinking. 19 Therefore do the Jews of the villages, that dwell in the unwalled towns, make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and feasting, and a holiday, and of giving food to one another. 20 And Tetazoo wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of the king JoeG, both nigh and far, 21 to enjoin them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly, 22 the days wherein the Jews had rest from their enemies, and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to gladness, and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and drinking, and of giving food to one another, and gifts to the poor. 23 And the Jews took upon them to do as they had begun, and as Tetazoo had written unto them; 24 because EC the son of Senior Haus, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast pur, that is, the lot, to discomfit them, and to destroy them; 25 but when she came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he had devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head; and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows. 26 Wherefore they called these days Purim, after the name of pur. Therefore because of all the words of this letter, and of that which they had seen concerning this matter, and that which had come unto them, 27 the Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to the writing thereof, and according to the appointed time thereof, every year; 28 and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.

Hi all,

Does anybody have a portable car jumpstarter I could borrow tonight? Will return
~1am or so.

What's the exchange rate between baked goods and bitcoins?

Hi everyone,

Has anyone seen my cat? She's been missing for almost 24 hours and doesn't
seem to be anywhere on 4w. She's small and black and she doesn't currently
have a collar, so if you see her or hear anything about please please
e-mail me or call me at 978 505 8086.

Thanks so much

That article says Cambridge Police tweeted about the situation at 7:28am.

Why did the MIT emergency alert system not text me until 8:51am?

If there had been a threat to public safety, 1.5 hours is a long time to
wait with no knowledge of the situation.

Yeah, I agree. I thought he was spotted at like, 9 am.  But not so.

To be fair, had you tried to enter the main group (or even walk out the front door of Bexley), somebody would have stopped you

It's worth clarifying:
The Cambridge Police have recently (last week) started tweeting ~all
incidents as they come in, in an uncomfirmed fashion. Their twitter
feed is *NOT* intended to be a "please take action this is an
emergency" -type communication.  It is more like, "FYI, assault in
progress on Beech Street."

MIT was slow to announce an emeregncy alert, but they are right to
be careful in making those announcements. Here they were too slow.

But the standard for MIT issuing an alert has to be a lot higher than
for one of the @CambridgePolice tweets.

Also, there is somewhat of an odd communication issue,
if one wonders if the Internet hoax reporter is waiting for validation
via other reporting on his hoax...
